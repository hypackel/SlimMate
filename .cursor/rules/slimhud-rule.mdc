[rule: slimhud-competitor-reference]
when I ask about how SlimHUD does something,
  search the codebase in ./SlimHUDNotPartOfApp
  and use that to inform the answer.

SlimHUD is a competitor project located in the ./SlimHUDNotPartOfApp directory.
It is not part of the main application but has implemented many similar features.
Use SlimHUD as a reference point only when explicitly mentioned.
